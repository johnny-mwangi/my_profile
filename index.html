  <h2>About John Mwangi</h2>    
  <p>
    I am an energetic, ambitious person who have developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake or situation that am presented with.
</p>
  <p>I have 4 months working experience with CHIMPVINE KENYA, as a part time volunteer on using search engine to do some research. This has equipped me with good quality skills on doing research and delivering timely results. The research has been a team work which has made ma a good team player to achieve an objective as a team.   I have 2 months graphic design skills working with this organization. I have been using CANVA and PHOTOSHOP CC 2019.
</p>
    <p>I have skills in web design using Figma, I also have knowledge on frontend development using Javascript, html and css. I have managed to develop 2 trial websites which are static. Am open to learning backend and be a full stack developer in future.  
</p>
    <p>
    During my course work, there is a mandatory industrial attachment. In my attachment I gained skills in computer troubleshooting and resolving computer network issues. The 2 months attachment gave me a chance to learn different ways to use social media in a secure way to ensure there is no cyber bullying.
